				Welcome to IA!  The goal here is very simple - to make technical reading of all kinds easier for YOU by removing any mystery about what all those initialisms and acronyms in your field mean!  Frequently when reading technical work, we are bombarded with a slew of such abbreviations that are all too easy to forget or just be innocently ignorant of. But no more!

				This is very much a work in progress!  As you may have noticed, at the moment, the only technical subject's IAs available are for Biology.  This is currently a one-man side project and there are thousands of initialisms and acronyms for Biology alone (about the top 100 are here right now for you though)!  More of all kinds to come soon!  Also, if you're interested in helping out with this project or have any input whatsoever, please check out the github page here, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/kyserrecchia/IA-InitialismsAndAcronyms">https://www.github.com/kyserrecchia/IA-InitialismsAndAcronyms</a>, and feel free to contact me personally on linkedin, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-serrecchia/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-serrecchia/</a>
